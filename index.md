## My Process
When it comes to work, professionalism is at the very core for me. Troubleshooting technical issues until it resolves, is what I have been keen on. I have proven to be detail-oriented and a collaborative team player during my days as L1 and L2 technical support engineer. 
As a L2 technical support engineer, I've also had to play the role of a pseudo team lead during peak time, and the feedback I've often received is as 'approachable', 'knows to maintain the calm, during peak and busy hours', 'maintains the same high standards and professionalism  even when under pressure'.
Ability to communicate effectively with all levels of technical proficiency, incorporating industry level email and phone and in-person etiquettes. 
Creativity and emotional intelligence have also always been a significant contribution to my overall work pattern
