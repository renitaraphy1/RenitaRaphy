        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>5+ years of experience as a Technical Support Engineer and Backup Admin in the Data Protection domain. Due to receive my second master’s degree in 2024, I have acquired technical knowledge and skills from my course as well as practical and business skills from my years of experience working in a software MNC in India. I have used a range of languages during my courses and worked on different operating systems, project management tools, and data protection tools throughout my work experience. I am keen to develop as a data protection engineer and further enhance my skills within a busy IT infrastructure team.</p>
